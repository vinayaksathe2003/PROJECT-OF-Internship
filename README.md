PROJECT 1 :- Sales Data Analysis using Python

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES :- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Data Cleaning & EDA

ABOUT PROJECT :-
Performed end-to-end exploratory data analysis on retail sales dataset to extract business insights. Cleaned and preprocessed raw transactional data by handling missing values, duplicate records and incorrect data formats. Conducted statistical analysis to identify sales trends, seasonal patterns and customer purchasing behavior. Developed visual dashboards and charts to represent revenue distribution, top-selling products and region-wise performance. Generated actionable insights to support decision-making and improve business strategy.

PROJECT 2 :- Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning & Python

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES :- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Feature Engineering, Regression Models

ABOUT PROJECT :-
Built a machine learning regression model to predict airline ticket prices based on travel parameters such as airline, source, destination, duration, stops and journey date. Performed data preprocessing including encoding categorical variables and feature extraction from datetime columns. Trained multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree and compared performance using evaluation metrics. Optimized model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. The final model was able to estimate approximate ticket price ranges for future bookings.

PROJECT 3 :- Music Store Data Analysis using SQL

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES :- MySQL, Joins, Subqueries, Aggregate Functions, Window Functions

ABOUT PROJECT :-
Analyzed relational music store database to derive business insights using SQL queries. Wrote complex queries involving joins, nested queries and grouping operations to identify top customers, best-selling artists, popular genres and revenue contribution by country. Implemented window functions to rank customers and analyze purchase behavior patterns. Optimized queries for performance and ensured accurate data retrieval. The analysis helped in understanding customer preferences and improving sales strategy.

PROJECT 4 :- Airbnb Price Prediction using Python & Machine Learning

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES :- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Feature Engineering, Regression Models

ABOUT PROJECT :-
Developed a predictive model to estimate Airbnb property prices based on listing attributes such as location, room type, availability and reviews. Cleaned large real-world dataset and handled outliers and skewed distributions. Applied feature engineering techniques including encoding and normalization. Trained and evaluated multiple regression algorithms and selected the best performing model. The model provided estimated rental price ranges useful for hosts and customers.
